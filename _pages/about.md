Hi, my name is Andrew! I'm a current Masters in Artificial Intelligence student at Northwestern and a Visiting Researcher at Harvard Medical School. I completed my undergraduate education at UC San Diego in Bioinformatics and Computer Science, and I am interested in solving problems in the intersection of AI and science. 

Feel free to reach out to connect!
